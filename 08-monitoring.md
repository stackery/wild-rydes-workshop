# Monitoring
In this module, we will set up monitoring for our application.

# Instructions
### 1. Configure alerts for your application
To be able to react to issues in your application, you can configure
alerts for your application.<br>
First, go to
[Notification rules](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/alerts), and select 
[Create New](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/alerts/new). Create an alert for the
`stackery-wild-rydes-production` application:
![Create new Alert](images/08-new-alert.png)

after your alert was created, you can manage it in the
[Notification rules](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/alerts) tab:
![Notification rules](images/08-notification-rules.png)

### 2. Trigger an error in the application
Trigger an alert in the application (like in the previous modules). You
will receive an alert via the medium you configured:
